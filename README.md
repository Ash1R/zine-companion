A companion website for the AI&I magazine made 
by my group at S.H.T.E.M program, published by
the Stanford Compression Forum

Includes a poetic chatbot, an infinite crossword puzzle, and an aesthetic timeline of the history of AI. 
The printed version of the magazine contained sentiment analysis matched to colors using NLP libraries.

All programming done by me, with excellent ideas given by
Devon Baur and Marieke Gaboury
